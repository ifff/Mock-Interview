1. (Song) Recognize whether two nodes in binary tree are cousin relationship. O(n)
    
   Two nodes are cousin of each other if they are at same level and have different parents.
    
        Solution1:
   
        level order traversal to check if two nodes are at same level and keep records of the parents of two nodes. Time: O(n) Space: O(n)
       
        Solution2:
       
        design a function to return the depth of a node and another function to return the parent of a node. Time: O(n) Space: O(1) if ignore the stack space
     
   
2. (Song) How many distinct number of descendants for each node in complete tree. T(n) = T(n/2) + O(logn) ->  T(n) = O(logn)

        Solution: 
        
        We find that at lease one subtree of complete tree is a full tree. The distinct number of descendants for each node in a full tree equals to the level of the tree. For another tree, we recursively solve the same problem.
      
3. (Song) add a new node to the end of complete tree.Solution O(n): 
    * Travel three using Breath First Search, if a node have no two children, then add new child node to it.
    * Travel from left child and right child respectively, the left pointer go down across right child always, and right pointer go down across left child always.
4. (Song) DP problem: Find an optimal path from top left to bottom right, the overall weights of Path are calculated as the following formula: a1a2 + a3a4 + a5a6 + â€¦

        Solution:
        
        if (i+j)&1
          dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j] + cost[i-1][j]*cost[i][j], dp[i][j-1] + cost[i][j-1]*cost[i][j])
        else
          dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j])

5. (Song) Given an integer array, find three different integers A, B, C satisfying A - B = C. 

        Solution:
        
        find A = B + C
        
        We first sort the array, then we enumerate A from back to front. Suppose A is num[i], then we enumerate B and C in the intervel [0, i-1].
        
        Time: O(n^2) Space: O(n)
        
6. (Cheng) Given a string, you are required to find a max length sub-string, and the number of distinct characters is at most m.
7. (Cheng) Given a random generator RandInt6, which return a random number ranging from 0~5 with equal possibility. 
8. (Xue) Given an undirected graph, check whether it is a tree or not. Find & Union
9. (Xue) Print the numbers between 0~100 by lexicographic order.
