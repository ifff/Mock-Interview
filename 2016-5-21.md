1. (Song) Recognize whether two nodes in binary tree are cousin relationship. O(n)
2. (Song) How many distinct number of descendants for each node in complete tree. T(n) = T(n/2) + O(logn) ->  T(n) = O(logn)
3. (Song) add a new node to the end of complete tree.Solution O(n): 
    - Travel three using Breath First Search, if a node have no two children, then add new child node to it.
    - Travel from left child and right child respectively, the left pointer go down across right child always, and right pointer go down across left child always.
4. (Song) DP problem: Find an optimal path from top left to bottom right, the overall weights of Path are calculated as the following formula: a1*a2 + a3*a4 + a5*a6 + â€¦
5. (Song) Given an integer array, find three different integers A, B, C satisfying A + B = C. 
6. (Cheng) Given a string, you are required to find a max length sub-string, and the number of distinct characters is at most m.
7. (Cheng) Given a random generator RandInt6, which return a random number ranging from 0~5 with equal possibility. 
8. (Xue) Given an undirected graph, check whether it is a tree or not. Find & Union
9. (Xue) Print the numbers between 0~100 by lexicographic order.
